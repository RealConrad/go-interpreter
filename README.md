# Monkey Interpreter

This repository contains a Monkey interpreter written in Go, inspired by the book **[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) _written by Thorsten Ball_**. This project serves as a way for me to learn Go concepts through practical implementation.

Monkey is a simple, toy programming language used to demonstrate the concepts of writing an interpreter from scratch. This interpreter, implemented in Go, parses and executes Monkey language code, allowing for basic operations and control structures.
